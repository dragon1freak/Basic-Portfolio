                    My name is James Ritchey and I've been coding since I was
                    around 13 years old, and ever since then it's been a passion
                    of mine. I work on personal projects in my spare time, working 
                    mostly on game projects in both the C# and C++ languages.  I've
                    also had some experience with Java, Python, and VPython, and though 
                    it's mostly been self-taught, I've also studied at North Carolina
                    State University.
